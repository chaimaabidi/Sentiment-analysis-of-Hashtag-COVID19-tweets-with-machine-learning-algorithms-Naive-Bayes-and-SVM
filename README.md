This work presents a study of the impact of linguistic preprocessing (removal of stop words, etc.) on sentiment classification. We evaluate this impact on 1 corpus of tweets with the covid19 hashtag. We did a sentimental analysis on a second corpus of Covid19 tweets. Two classification techniques are used: Na√Øve bayes and Support Vector Machines. We compared the classification results of the two machine learning methods in an empirical way.
To better deepen our comparative study, we used 2 Kaggel Datasets:
presentation of the first Dataset and exploratory analysis
The first Dataset is downloaded from the address: https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid19-tweets published on 08/30/2020.
In the first part, our DataSet is composed of tweets that are collected using the Twitter API and a Python script for word processing. A query for this high frequency hashtag (#covid19) is run daily for a certain period from 25/07/2020 to collect more sample tweets.
presentation of the second Dataset and exploratory analysis
The second dataset is downloadable from the address: https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification published on 08/09/2020
The second DataSet to perform text classification on the data, tweets were extracted from Twitter and then manual markup was performed. UserName and ScreenName in the Dataset and received codes to avoid any privacy issues.
