This work presents a study of the impact of linguistic preprocessing (removal of stop words, etc.) on sentiment classification. We evaluate this impact on 1 corpus of tweets with the covid19 hashtag. We did a sentimental analysis on a second corpus of Covid19 tweets. Two classification techniques are used: Naïve bayes and Support Vector Machines. We compared the classification results of the two machine learning methods in an empirical way.
To better deepen our comparative study, we used 2 Kaggel Datasets:

Language used:

Python

Files:

1.Prétraitement_du_Texte_PT.ipynb is the first Jupyter Notebook containing my work.

    Corona_NLP_test.csv is the first data used.
    
2.Classification_texte_CT.ipynb is the second Jupyter Notebook containing my work.

    covid19_tweets.csv is the second data used (The second dataset is downloadable from the address: https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification       published on 08/09/2020, to perform text classification on the data)
