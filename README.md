This work presents a study of the impact of linguistic preprocessing (removal of stop words, etc.) on sentiment classification. We evaluate this impact on 1 corpus of tweets with the covid19 hashtag. We did a sentimental analysis on a second corpus of Covid19 tweets. Two classification techniques are used: Na√Øve bayes and Support Vector Machines. We compared the classification results of the two machine learning methods in an empirical way.
